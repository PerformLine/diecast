## tl;dr

Diecast is an all-in-one program that lets you build websites using conventional web programming tools (HTML, JavaScript, CSS/Sass) as well as a rich templating framework for handling complex tasks server-side.  A key feature is the use of _data bindings_, which allows your templates to consume remote content (RESTful APIs, Redis, and more).  This declarative approach eliminates many of the ambiguities that regularly appear in conventional MVC/server-side frameworks.

## Introduction

Diecast is a web server that allows you to render a directory tree of template files into HTML, CSS or anything other text-based media in real-time.  Data can be retrieved from remote sources during the template rendering process, creating dynamic web pages built by consuming APIs and remote files without the need to use client-side Javascript/AJAX calls or an intermediate server framework.
