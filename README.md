## Introduction

Diecast is a web server that allows you to render a directory tree of template files into HTML, CSS or anything other text-based media in real-time.  Data can be retrieved from remote sources during the template rendering process, creating dynamic web pages built by consuming APIs and remote files without the need to use client-side Javascript/AJAX calls or an intermediate server framework.
