bindings:
# create a binding called "my_api_endpoint" that is automatically evaluated for all
# routes (i.e. any starting with "/") requested via the GET method
#
# The request will be proxied to the given 'resource' URL using the 'resource_method'
# HTTP method (GET by default).  The upstream request will include the `query_string_key1'
# query string parameter, which will be equal to the route query string
# parameter 'request_query_string_key1'
#
  # - name: 'my_api_endpoint'
  #   method: 'GET'
  #   resource:        "http://my-api.example.com/api/path/to/endpoint"
  #   params:
  #     query_string_key1: :request_query_string_key1

  # - name:            'other_api_endpoint'
  #   resource:        ":/api/other/endpoint"

# mounts:
# # expose the server-side directory '/usr/local/share/thing-shared' under the top-level URL path '/assets'
# #
# - mount: /assets
#   path:  /usr/local/share/thing-shared

# # expose the server-side directory '/usr/share/thing-shared' under the top-level URL path '/assets'
# # but return a 404 if the requested file isn't there (as opposed to trying any additional
# # mount paths after this one)
# #
# - mount: /assets
#   path:  /usr/share/thing-shared
#   passthrough: false
